# hello-world

Hi there!

Branching off the guide, I too looove tacos, but maybe not as much as I love cheese.
I also love reading stories on episode, if you have ever heard of the app.
I have two cats, Hannibal and Clarice. Kudos to you if you get the reference.
My boyfriend and I enjoy the movie and tv series.
